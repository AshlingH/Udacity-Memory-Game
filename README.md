##How to install Game

Click the green clone/download button to download a local copy of the game. Then open the index.html file with your favourite browser.

##Dependencies

I used Font-awesome library for the cards symbols.



## How to play

This is a Memory Game. The idea is to match the cards that have the same icon on them. The cards are flipped over so you have to click on them to turn them over. If they don't match they will flip back over and you have to remember where each cards was. The least amount of moves the better. There is also a star rating system based on the number of moves.
